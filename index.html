<h1>Kikicat123's Void</h1>
<h3>Welcome!</h3>
This is my personal site. It's designed to look this way on purpose, for those with limited internet bandwidth. This whole page is just over 2.1KiB.<br />
Why? A) cause I can, B) 3 hours a day I have literal dial-up speeds, and C) I'm lazy, and this is easier to maintain. <br /> 
Any links that lead to "modern" subpages (high bandwidth pages) will be marked with an asterisk (*). <br />
<br />
<h3>Stuff you may want to know:</h3>
<ul> <!-- melon wanted a comment so here -->
    <li>I use linux (Debian/KDE, for those wondering. No, I don't care that your preferred distro is "better.")</li>
    <li>My Prefered IDE is VSCode, and My preferred languages to program in are NodeJS (for small projects) and Golang (everything else)</li>
    <li>No, I don't know why you can't print. And more importantly, I don't care.</li>
    <li>Fuck your units. I don't care if they are SI or not, they still suck. No, I won't suggest alternatives.</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
Copilot wrote this next line for me: <br />
<i>It's a good thing I don't have a girlfriend, because I would be too busy to maintain this site.</i> <br />
Nice one, Copilot. <br />
