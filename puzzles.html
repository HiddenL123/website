<h1>Kikicat123's Ultimate Puzzle Game List (pat. pending)</h1>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0%;">What is this?</h3>
This is a list of puzzle games I've played, and my thoughts on them. I'll try to keep it updated, but I'm lazy, and often forgetful, so no promises. <br />
If I've missed any games, contact me on Discord (kikicat123 (hash) 0001) or email me at kiki (at) (this domain). I'll add them to the list. <br /> <br />
These puzzle games all have a few things in common: <br />
a) They are all pretty hard, but very rewarding. I'd encourage you to not look things up while playing. <br />
b) They are (almost) all on steam. I prefer to use steam for games, but i've made exceptions for some games. <br />
c) They have all passed my worth-it metric: For every Canadian Dollar spent, I've gotten at least 1 hour of entertainment. <br />
Prices listed are as of April 2023. I have probably accidentally included a sale price, If I have let me know.<br />
